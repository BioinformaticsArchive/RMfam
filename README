1. INTRODUCTION

RMfam is a database of annotated multiple sequence alignments and
probabilistic models for a number of RNA motifs. For the purposes of
this work an RNA motif is a recurring RNA sequence and/or secondary
structure found within larger structures that can be modelled by
either a covariance model or a profile HMM. RMfam is modelled loosely
on the Rfam and Pfam databases and draws a lot of ideas from these
resources.
