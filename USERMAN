The RMfam database of RNA motifs
--------------------------------

This document describes the format of RMfam flat files.  


Alignment format 
---------------- 

RMfam alignments are in a blocked format called Stockholm format.  This
allows mark-ups of four types:

  #=GF <featurename> <Generic per-file annotation, free text>

  #=GC <featurename> <Generic per-column annotation, exactly 1
       character per column>

  #=GS <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-sequence annotation, free
       text>

  #=GR <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-sequence AND per-column
       mark up, exactly 1 character per column>

The full description of Stockholm format can be found at:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format

RMfam alignments contain #=GC SS_cons lines describing the consensus
secondary structure of the sequences in the family, and #=GC RF lines
which describe the match/insert states of the model.  RMfam uses #=GF
lines extensively to provide family mark-up and annotation in the
fields described below.


Compulsory fields
-----------------

  AC   Accession number:          RMFxxxxx

       The RMfam accession numbers RMFxxxxx are the stable identifier
       for each RMfam family.

  ID   Identification:            15 characters or less

       This field is designed to be a meaningful identifier for the
       family.  The identifier is not necessarily stable between
       releases.

  DE   Description:               80 characters or less

       A one line description of the family.

  AU   Author:

       Author of the entry -- format shown below.

       AU   Bloggs JJ, Bloggs JE

  SE   Source of seed alignment:    

       Where RMfam has repackaged data from other sources, these
       sources will be referenced here.  This field may also point to
       key references for the alignment, or the name of the author of
       the seed alignment.

  SS   Source of secondary structure

       This field indicates whether the secondary structure is
       predicted or published.  Structure prediction software or
       PUBMED identifier for a publication are shown.  Either may
       be qualified with an author name.  Examples of format are
       shown below:

       SS   Predicted; PFOLD
       SS   Published; PMID:11283358

  GA   Gathering threshold:   

       The bit score threshold above which all hits are considered
       real.


  SQ   Sequences:
       
       Number of sequences in the alignment.

  //   End of record


Non-compulsory fields
---------------------

  PI   Previous IDs:             Semi-colon list

       The most recent names are stored on the left.

  DR   Database Reference:       Reference to external database source.

       All DR lines end in a semicolon.  For example:

       DR   URL; http://jwbrown.mbio.ncsu.edu/RNaseP/home.html;

  RN   Reference Number:         Digit in square brackets

       Reference numbers are used to precede literature references,
       which have multiple line entries

       RN   [1]

  RM   Reference Medline:        Eight digit number

       An example RM line is shown below

       RM   91006031

       The number can be found as the UI number in pubmed
       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/

  RT   Reference Title:                    

       Title of paper.

  RA   Reference Author:

       All RA lines use the following format

       RA   Bateman A, Eddy SR, Mesyanzhinov VV;

  RL   Reference Location:

       The reference line is in the format below.
       RL  Journal abbreviation year;volume:page-page.

       RL   Virus Genes 1997;14:163-165.
       RL   J Mol Biol 1994;242:309-320.

       Journal abbreviations can be checked at
       http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/jourlist?jourlist.txt. Journal
       abbreviation have no full stops, and page numbers are not
       abbreviated.

  CC   Comment:
 
       Comment lines provide annotation and other information.
       Annotation in CC lines does not have a strict format.

       syntax:
       RMFAM:RMFxxxxx.

       Links to Rfam families can be provided with the following
       syntax:
       RFAM:RFxxxxx.

       Links to EMBL sequences can be provided with the following

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stockholm formatted alignments that have been annotated by RMfam may
also include:

#=GF MT.x <RMfam ID>  
      -Where 'x' is any alphanumeric character. This line provides a
       mapping between the RMfam entry and a unique single character
       that can be used to markup regions in a sequence that match a
       motif.

#=GR <Seq ID> MT.n ....
      -Where 'n' is a number. This line marks the regions of a
       sequence that match motif 'x' defined above.
